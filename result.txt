HAMLET. I am very glad to see you.—Good even, sir.— But what, in faith,
HAMLET. I beseech you, remember,—
HAMLET. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the
HAMLET. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
HAMLET. I dare not drink yet, madam. By and by.
HAMLET. I do beseech you.
HAMLET. I do not think so. Since he went into France, I have been in
HAMLET. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
HAMLET. I embrace it freely, And will this brother’s wager frankly
HAMLET. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath given
HAMLET. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or
HAMLET. I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this waterfly?
HAMLET. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
HAMLET. I lov’d Ophelia; forty thousand brothers Could not, with all
HAMLET. I mean, my head upon your lap?
HAMLET. I must to England, you know that?
HAMLET. I pray you.
HAMLET. I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student. I think it was to see
HAMLET. I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England!
HAMLET. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
HAMLET. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in’t.
HAMLET. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark
HAMLET. I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet
HAMLET. I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your
HAMLET. I will watch tonight; Perchance ’twill walk again.
HAMLET. I will.
HAMLET. I would I had been there.
HAMLET. I would not hear your enemy say so; Nor shall you do my ear
HAMLET. I would you did, sir; yet in faith if you did, it would not
HAMLET. If it assume my noble father’s person, I’ll speak to it, though
HAMLET. If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry.
HAMLET. In happy time.
HAMLET. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
HAMLET. In my mind’s eye, Horatio.
HAMLET. In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true; she is a
HAMLET. Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me. Hold you the watch
HAMLET. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
HAMLET. Into my grave?
HAMLET. Is’t possible?
HAMLET. Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?
HAMLET. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
HAMLET. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as
HAMLET. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
HAMLET. It shall to the barber’s, with your beard.—Prythee say on. He’s
HAMLET. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
HAMLET. It waves me still. Go on, I’ll follow thee.
HAMLET. It will be short. The interim is mine; And a man’s life’s no
HAMLET. It will not speak; then will I follow it.
HAMLET. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
HAMLET. Judgment.
HAMLET. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
HAMLET. Let her not walk i’ th’ sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
HAMLET. Let me see. [_Takes the skull._] Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him,
HAMLET. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
HAMLET. Look here upon this picture, and on this, The counterfeit
HAMLET. Madam, how like you this play?
HAMLET. Make you a wholesome answer. My wit’s diseased. But, sir, such
HAMLET. Marry, this is miching mallicho; it means mischief.
HAMLET. Methinks it is like a weasel.
HAMLET. Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
HAMLET. Mother, you have my father much offended.
HAMLET. Murder!
HAMLET. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
HAMLET. My fate cries out, And makes each petty artery in this body As
HAMLET. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
HAMLET. My mother. Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is

HAMLET. Nay, I know not. is it the King?
HAMLET. Nay, but swear’t.
HAMLET. Nay, but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed, Stew’d
HAMLET. Nay, come again!
HAMLET. Nay, do not think I flatter; For what advancement may I hope
HAMLET. Nay, that follows not.
HAMLET. Never make known what you have seen tonight.
HAMLET. Never to speak of this that you have seen. Swear by my sword.
HAMLET. No such matter. I will not sort you with the rest of my
HAMLET. No, believe me, ’tis very cold, the wind is northerly.
HAMLET. No, by the rood, not so. You are the Queen, your husband’s
HAMLET. No, by this hand.
HAMLET. No, faith, not a jot. But to follow him thither with modesty
HAMLET. No, good mother, here’s metal more attractive.
HAMLET. No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i’ th’
HAMLET. No, nor mine now. [_To Polonius._] My lord, you play’d once i’
HAMLET. No, not I. I never gave you aught.
HAMLET. No, you’ll reveal it.
HAMLET. Nor did you nothing hear?
HAMLET. Nor the soles of her shoe?
HAMLET. Not a whit, we defy augury. There’s a special providence in the
HAMLET. Not so, my lord, I am too much i’ the sun.
HAMLET. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do: Let the bloat King
HAMLET. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain convocation
HAMLET. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
HAMLET. Nothing.
HAMLET. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying. And now I’ll do’t.
HAMLET. Now, mother, what’s the matter?
HAMLET. O God!
HAMLET. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a
HAMLET. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
HAMLET. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
HAMLET. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else? And shall I
HAMLET. O good Horatio, I’ll take the ghost’s word for a thousand
HAMLET. O my prophetic soul! Mine uncle!
HAMLET. O reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns
HAMLET. O that this too too solid flesh would melt, Thaw, and resolve
HAMLET. O throw away the worser part of it, And live the purer with the
HAMLET. O villany! Ho! Let the door be lock’d: Treachery! Seek it out.
HAMLET. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no
HAMLET. O, I die, Horatio. The potent poison quite o’er-crows my
HAMLET. O, but she’ll keep her word.
HAMLET. O, wonderful!
HAMLET. Of him, sir.
HAMLET. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
HAMLET. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares, His form and cause
HAMLET. One.
HAMLET. Or like a whale.
HAMLET. Or of a courtier, which could say ‘Good morrow, sweet lord! How
HAMLET. Pale, or red?
HAMLET. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit. So, gentlemen, With all my love I
HAMLET. Safely stowed.
HAMLET. Saw? Who?
HAMLET. Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems. ’Tis not alone my
HAMLET. She well instructs me.
HAMLET. Sir, I cannot.
HAMLET. Sir, I lack advancement.
HAMLET. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty, it
HAMLET. Sir, a whole history.

HAMLET. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a
HAMLET. So much for this, sir. Now let me see the other; You do
HAMLET. So you mistake your husbands.—Begin, murderer. Pox, leave thy
HAMLET. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,
HAMLET. Speak, I am bound to hear.
HAMLET. Such an act That blurs the grace and blush of modesty, Calls
HAMLET. That’s a fair thought to lie between maids’ legs.
HAMLET. That’s two of his weapons. But well.
HAMLET. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
HAMLET. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
HAMLET. That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.
HAMLET. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the
HAMLET. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights
HAMLET. The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse, Keeps wassail,
HAMLET. The King my father!
HAMLET. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
HAMLET. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.
HAMLET. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
HAMLET. The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry
HAMLET. The point envenom’d too! Then, venom, to thy work.
HAMLET. Then I would you were so honest a man.
HAMLET. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch’d
HAMLET. Then came each actor on his ass—
HAMLET. Then is doomsday near. But your news is not true. Let me
HAMLET. Then saw you not his face?
HAMLET. Then will I come to my mother by and by.—They fool me to the
HAMLET. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?
HAMLET. There’s another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
HAMLET. There’s letters seal’d: and my two schoolfellows, Whom I will
HAMLET. There’s ne’er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he’s an

HAMLET. They are coming to the play. I must be idle. Get you a place.
HAMLET. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I
HAMLET. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
HAMLET. This?
HAMLET. Thou dost lie in’t, to be in’t and say it is thine. ’Tis for

HAMLET. Thy state is the more gracious; for ’tis a vice to know him. He
HAMLET. To be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether ’tis nobler
HAMLET. To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
HAMLET. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
HAMLET. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats Will not debate
HAMLET. Up from my cabin, My sea-gown scarf’d about me, in the dark
HAMLET. Upon my sword.
HAMLET. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
HAMLET. Upon what ground?
HAMLET. Very like, very like. Stay’d it long?
HAMLET. Very well, my lord. Your Grace has laid the odds o’ the weaker
HAMLET. Very well. Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.
HAMLET. We’ll ha’t tomorrow night. You could for a need study a speech
HAMLET. We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel;
HAMLET. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
HAMLET. Well said, old mole! Canst work i’ th’earth so fast? A worthy
HAMLET. Well, God-a-mercy.
HAMLET. What’s his weapon?
HAMLET. What’s the matter now?
HAMLET. What call you the carriages?
HAMLET. What did you enact?
HAMLET. What ho, Horatio!
HAMLET. What hour now?
HAMLET. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
HAMLET. What man dost thou dig it for?
HAMLET. What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
HAMLET. What woman then?
HAMLET. What, are they children? Who maintains ’em? How are they
HAMLET. What, frighted with false fire?
HAMLET. What, look’d he frowningly?
HAMLET. What, the fair Ophelia?
HAMLET. What?
HAMLET. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak, I’ll go no further.
HAMLET. Who commands them, sir?
HAMLET. Who is to be buried in’t?
HAMLET. Who, I?
HAMLET. Whose was it?
HAMLET. Why— ’One fair daughter, and no more, The which he loved
HAMLET. Why did you laugh then, when I said ‘Man delights not me’?
HAMLET. Why he more than another?
HAMLET. Why, As by lot, God wot, and then, you know, It came to pass,
HAMLET. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids
HAMLET. Why, anything. But to the purpose. You were sent for; and there
HAMLET. Why, e’en so: and now my Lady Worm’s; chapless, and knocked
HAMLET. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant. I had my father’s signet
HAMLET. Why, let the strucken deer go weep, The hart ungalled play; For
HAMLET. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
HAMLET. Why, look you there! look how it steals away! My father, in his
HAMLET. Why, man, they did make love to this employment. They are not
HAMLET. Why, right; you are i’ the right; And so, without more
HAMLET. Why, then ’tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or
HAMLET. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
HAMLET. Why, what should be the fear? I do not set my life at a pin’s
HAMLET. Why?
HAMLET. With drink, sir?
HAMLET. Words, words, words.
HAMLET. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, And much offence
HAMLET. You are welcome.
HAMLET. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
HAMLET. You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate
HAMLET. Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
HAMLET. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
HAMLET. Yours, yours.
HAMLET. [_Advancing._] What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis?
HAMLET. [_Aside._] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
HAMLET. [_Aside._] Nay, then I have an eye of you. If you love me, hold

HORATIO, Friend to Hamlet.

HORATIO. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave To tell us

LAERTES. A Norman was’t?
LAERTES. A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.
LAERTES. A touch, a touch, I do confess.
LAERTES. Alas, then she is drown’d?
LAERTES. And so have I a noble father lost, A sister driven into
LAERTES. Ay, my lord; So you will not o’errule me to a peace.
LAERTES. Come, my lord.
LAERTES. Come, one for me.
LAERTES. Do you see this, O God?
LAERTES. Dread my lord, Your leave and favour to return to France, From
LAERTES. Drown’d! O, where?
LAERTES. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well What I have said to you.
LAERTES. Farewell.
LAERTES. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour, Hold it a fashion

LAERTES. He is justly serv’d. It is a poison temper’d by himself.
LAERTES. How came he dead? I’ll not be juggled with. To hell,
LAERTES. How now! What noise is that?
LAERTES. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come, It warms the very
LAERTES. I am satisfied in nature, Whose motive in this case should

LAERTES. I thank you. Keep the door. O thou vile king, Give me my

LAERTES. Lay her i’ th’earth, And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
LAERTES. Let this be so; His means of death, his obscure burial,— No
LAERTES. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
LAERTES. Must there no more be done?
LAERTES. My lord, I’ll hit him now.
LAERTES. My lord, I will be rul’d; The rather if you could devise it so
LAERTES. My necessaries are embark’d. Farewell. And, sister, as the
LAERTES. My will, not all the world. And for my means, I’ll husband
LAERTES. No.
LAERTES. None but his enemies.
LAERTES. O, fear me not. I stay too long. But here my father comes.
LAERTES. O, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head Whose

LAERTES. That drop of blood that’s calm proclaims me bastard; Cries
LAERTES. Think it no more. For nature crescent does not grow alone In

LAERTES. This nothing’s more than matter.

LAERTES. What part is that, my lord?
LAERTES. Where is my father?
LAERTES. Where is this king?—Sirs, stand you all without.
LAERTES. Why ask you this?
LAERTES. Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric. I am justly
